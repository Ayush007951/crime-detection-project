I’m currently working on my Crime Detection project, analyzing crime data across India to identify patterns and trends. The project involves data collection, cleaning, and visualization, helping me gain practical experience in handling large datasets and deriving meaningful insights.

Looking forward to further exploring how data analysis and visualization can support informed decision-making and social awareness.
